# Roguelike-Ideas

Think Slay the Spire. The original idea is based on the player having a weapon in hand while attempting to beat the game. Most of the cards that you played would be editted by the weapon you were holding in some way eg.:

- if holding a sword all of your attacks deal 2 more damage
- if holding a dagger every other attack gets played twice
- if holding a spear at end of turn deal x damage where x is the number of attacks played that turn

The char could also hold something in the off hand as well:

- shield would add 2 to the block of each defensive card
- holy symbol would prevent any non-attack damage
- parry dagger would reflect a percent of an attack sustained

Instead of travelling 1 floor at a time and dealing with whatever is there, we could give the player more autonomy in making decisions so each floor would have 3 different monsters you could fight, and also 1 shop you could visit(blacksmith, leather goods etc.) AND 1 boss to fight. This way the user chooses which they want to do and the less monsters you fight before the boss the higher the reward for fighting the boss. This would create an interesting decision making process for the user, weighing up a potential price. After the boss was fought you would move on to the next floor.
